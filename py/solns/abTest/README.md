### AB Test
Your company is running a test that is designed to compare two different versions of the company’s website.

Version A of the website is shown to 60% of users, while version B of the website is shown to the remaining 40%. The test shows that 8% of users who are presented with version A sign up for the company’s services, as compared to 4% of users who are presented with version B.

If a user signs up for the company’s services, what is the probability that she/he was presented with version A of the website?

```
p(A)=0.6
p(B)=0.4
p(Y|A)=0.08
p(Y|B)=0.04
Answer = p(A|Y) = p(Y|A)p(A)/(p(Y|A)p(A)+p(Y|B)p(B)) = 0.75
