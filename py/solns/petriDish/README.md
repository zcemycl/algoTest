### Petri Dish
Two bacteria cultures, A and B, were set up in two different dishes, each covering 50% of its dish. Over 20 days, bacteria A's percentage of coverage increased to 70% and bacteria B's percentage of coverage reduced to 40%:

1. Which of the two bacterium's growth correlates more linearly with the number of days passed? 
```
B, since it is more smooth.
```
2. Approximately, what is the Pearson correlation coefficient of bacteria B's coverage and the number of days passed?
```
-1, since it is negatively correlated.
```
3. If, after 20 days, bacteria A's coverage starts to correlate less with its linear trend line, what can we say about the value of its Pearson correlation coefficient?
```
It will decrease.
